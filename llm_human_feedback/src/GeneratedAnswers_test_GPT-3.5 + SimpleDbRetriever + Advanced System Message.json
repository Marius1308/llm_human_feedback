According to the lecture material, the relative location of landmarks is considered nearly independent of the robot's coordinate frame.

On the other hand, the absolute location of landmarks is more uncertain because it is strongly related to the robot's coordinate frame.

For example, in the context of a mobile robot navigating an environment, minimizing costs can influence the robot's choice of path to reach a target location while considering various factors. In situations where there are multiple charging stations available, the robot can use minimal cost path planning to determine the most efficient route to a specific charging station (@Transcript Autonome Systeme und mobile Roboter SoSe 2023, Malte Schilling 10_transcript). The cost here refers to the number of actions or movements required to reach the destination (@Transcript Autonome Systeme und mobile Roboter SoSe 2023, Malte Schilling 10_transcript). By minimizing the number of movements, the robot can optimize its energy consumption and reduce the time needed for recharging, thereby enhancing its overall efficiency (@Transcript Autonome Systeme und mobile Roboter SoSe 2023, Malte Schilling 10_transcript).

                "context": "- Movement Planning through Internal Simulation:\n    - Robots understand properties of the surrounding by simulating specific movement plans.\n    - Robots can iterate and simulate different paths through internal or mental simulation.\n    - Example: A robot learns a model through perceptual space with a camera image.\n    - The robot does not build a map as an intermediate step, but learns directly from camera images. (Transcript Autonome Systeme und mobile Roboter SoSe 2023, Malte Schilling 10_transcript)\n\n- Path Planning as a Search Problem:\n    - Planning involves mental simulation, executing possible movements through trial-and-error.\n    - Steps: Check possible moves, choose and simulate one move, stop if goal reached, backtrack if in trouble.\n    - This process helps in decision-making and movement execution. (Slide: 10-slam-deck 15)\n\n- Application of SLAM 4 \u2013 Movement:\n    - For every frame, predict robot movement, make new observations, update internal representations.\n    - As the robot moves, its pose uncertainty increases, for example, due to wheel slippage. (Slide: 11-summary-deck 12)\n\n- Models in Robotic Systems:\n    - Different models such as forward models and inverse models are used to understand transformations.\n    - Forward models help in converting joint positions to taskspace coordinates for movement execution.\n    - Inverse models are used to select actions based on the state and environment feedback. (Transcript Autonome Systeme und mobile Roboter SoSe 2023, Malte Schilling 02_transcript)\n\n- Rewards and Reinforcement Learning:\n    - Robots take actions based on a chosen state and receive feedback in the form of new observations and reward signals.\n    - Reward signals indicate how well the robot performed, often used in locomotion tasks.\n    - Example: OpenAI's Shadow Hand solving a Rubik's Cube using reinforcement learning.

This is done by multiplying the prior probability, or the likelihood of the hypothesis for a fixed evidence, with the conditional probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. The resulting posterior probability represents the updated probability estimate for the hypothesis. The lecture material on Bayes' rule, specifically slides 51, 52, and 55, provide more details and examples on how Bayes' rule is applied in probabilistic localization methods. (@Slide '10-slam-deck' 51), (@Slide '10-slam-deck' 52), (@Slide '10-slam-deck' 55)\n\nThe product and sum rules from Slide 49 are related to the application of Bayes' rule in probabilistic localization methods. The product rule states that the joint probability of two events A and B can be calculated by multiplying the probability of A given B with the probability of B. This is used when the events A and B are independent. The sum rule, on the other hand, states that the joint probability of two events A and B can be calculated by summing the joint probabilities of A and B given different values of the other event. These rules are used in conjunction with Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probability in probabilistic localization methods.

                "context": "- Movement in SLAM:\n  - For every frame in SLAM, the robot predicts its movement, makes new observations, and updates its internal representations.\n  - As the robot moves, its pose uncertainty increases due to factors like wheel slippage.\n  - Common methods for SLAM solutions include Graph Slam, EKF-SLAM (Extended Kalman Filter), and Particle Filters like Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (FastSLAM). (Slide: 11-summary-deck 4, 10, 8)\n\n- Path Planning and Navigation:\n  - Path planning involves relating actions and the current state to predict the next state based on the last action and current state.\n  - Navigation focuses on the relationship between actions and the current state for movement.\n  - SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is essential for a robot to navigate in an unknown environment while simultaneously building a map of the surroundings. (Transcript Autonome Systeme und mobile Roboter SoSe 2023, Malte Schilling 10_transcript, 11_transcript)\n\n- SLAM in Robotics:\n  - SLAM involves simultaneously building a map of the environment while determining the position and orientation of the robot.\n  - The process of SLAM is challenging but beneficial when combined with simultaneous localization, as seen in examples like V-SLAM (Visual SLAM).\n  - The goal is to have the robot navigate and build a map when initially unaware of its surroundings.
