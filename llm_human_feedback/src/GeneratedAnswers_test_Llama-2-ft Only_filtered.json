It propagates a wave from the goal around obstacles and leaves a timestamp at each point until reaching the robot. This approach uses gradient information to minimize distance to the goal with each move (@10-slam-deck Slide 16). In comparison, Breadth-First Search explores space by layers or steps, while exploring all directions in parallel but tends to explore a huge number of cells (@10-slam-deck Slide 15, @10-slam-deck Slide 22). Therefore, we can see that there is a clear relationship between these two algorithms based on their exploration strategies.",

                "completeAnswer": "Sure! I'll provide a detailed explanation of how each method handles the accumulation of uncertainty in robot localization and offer examples to help you understand their application.\n\n1. GraphSLAM:\nGraphSLAM handles the accumulation of uncertainty by using a graph structure where nodes represent positions or orientations and links represent transitions between these states based on predictions and actual sensory readouts (@09-Localization-deck Slide 46). This approach allows for updating estimations when there are differences between predicted and observed positions or orientations.\n\nExample: An autonomous robot uses GraphSLAM to navigate through a environment by maintaining a graph representation that reflects its positional and orientational uncertainty while continuously updating its estimations based on new sensory inputs (@09-Localization-deck Slide 46).\n\n2. EKF-SLAM:\nEKF-SLAF handles uncertainty through an error correction method where current estimates are updated based on sensory readouts (@09-Localization-deck Slide 47). This approach helps mitigate errors accumulating over time.\n\nExample: An autonomous vehicle utilizes EKF-SLAM to account for uncertainty in its positioning by continuously estimating and correcting its position based on sensor feedback (@09-Localization-deck Slide 47).\n\n3. Particle Filter:\nParticle Filter handles large numbers of variables effectively by representing each particle with four variables: position, velocity, error, and weight (@09-Localization-deck Slide 50). This allows for updating only those particles that are closely matching the current predictions.\n\nExample: A robot uses a particle filter to spread output positions over a range of possible configurations while reducing uncertainty by updating only those particles that closely match current predictions (@09-Localization-deck Slide 50).\n\nI hope these examples help you understand how these localization methods handle the accumulation of uncertainty in robot localization!",
                "groundTruthAnswer": "In addressing the issue of accumulation of uncertainty in robot localization, GraphSLAM, EKF-SLAM (Extended Kalman Filter), and Particle Filters such as Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (FastSLAM) provide probabilistic solutions to handle uncertainty accumulation during robot localization processes by effectively integrating sensor measurements into belief state updates while considering motion models and observation data (@10-slam-deck Slide 65). While there are no specific illustrations provided on these slides for how these methods work in practice, you can refer to additional resources or textbooks that may contain visual examples or simulations demonstrating their application in real-world scenarios.",
