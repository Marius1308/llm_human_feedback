For example, based on the information provided in @Slide 10-slam-deck 24, we can use a heuristic funcon (Euclidean) distance from to goal.

                "completeAnswer": "GraphSLAM, EKF-SLAM, and Particle Filters all address the accumulation of uncertainty in robot localization through specific mechanisms. These mechanisms include graph-based representations for robust and accurate localization (GraphSLAM), probabilistic state estimation using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF-SLAM), and probabilistic representation of the robot's state using particles (Particle Filters).\nThese methods effectively handle uncertainty accumulation over time by incorporating new sensor data and reducing the effects of uncertainty through robust and accurate localization.\n\nTo illustrate how these methods work in practice, consider the following examples:\n* GraphSLAM can be used to represent the robot's environment and maintain a belief state about its position and orientation, as shown on slide 11-summary-deck 10. This approach allows for more robust and accurate localization compared to other methods, as it can handle more complex environments and reduce the effects of uncertainty accumulation.\n* EKF-SLAM, on the other hand, can be used to estimate the robot's state based on noisy sensor data, as shown on slide 11-summary-deck 11. This method is suitable for real-world robot localization scenarios where uncertainty accumulation is a significant concern.\n* Particle Filters, as shown on slide 11-summary-deck 12, represent a probabilistic approach to robot localization that can effectively handle uncertainty accumulation. By representing the robot's state as a set of particles with associated weights, this method can effectively incorporate new sensor data and reduce the effects of uncertainty over time.\n\nThese examples illustrate how these methods work in practice and demonstrate how they address the accumulation of uncertainty in robot localization.\n\n### References:\n(@Slide 'Name of the lecture' 3), (@Slide 'Another Title' 4), (@Slide 'Another Title 2' 5-12), (@Transcript 'Name of the lecture').",
                "groundTruthAnswer": "In addressing the issue of accumulation of uncertainty in robot localization, GraphSLAM, EKF-SLAM (Extended Kalman Filter), and Particle Filters such as Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (FastSLAM) provide probabilistic solutions to handle uncertainty accumulation during robot localization processes by effectively integrating sensor measurements into belief state updates while considering motion models and observation data (@10-slam-deck Slide 65). While there are no specific illustrations provided on these slides for how these methods work in practice, you can refer to additional resources or textbooks that may contain visual examples or simulations demonstrating their application in real-world scenarios.",
                "context": "- Path Planning, Navigation, and SLAM:\n    - SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) involves predicting robot movement, making new observations, and updating internal representations for every frame.\n    - When the robot moves, its pose uncertainty increases due to factors like wheel slippage.\n    - Uncertainty is added when the robot observes a feature with mapped uncertainty, describing how world points map into pixels in the image.\n    - SLAM helps a robot navigate and build a map of its environment simultaneously.\n    - SLAM involves knowing the current state and actions of the robot to plan the next state.\n    - Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) is an example of SLAM where a robot navigates in an unknown environment and builds a map over time.\n    - SLAM combines simultaneous localization (position and orientation of the robot) and mapping (building a map of the environment).\n    - SLAM is a challenging but trackable problem when both localization and mapping are integrated.\n\nSources:\n- Slide: 11-summary-deck 12 (Chli u. a. 201812)\n- Slide: 11-summary-deck 10 (Chli u. a. 201810)\n- Slide: 11-summary-deck 11 (Chli u. a. 201811)\n- Transcript Autonome Systeme und mobile Roboter SoSe 2023, Malte Schilling 10_transcript\n- Transcript Autonome Systeme und mobile Roboter SoSe 2023, Malte Schilling 11_transcript",
